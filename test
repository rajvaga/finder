✅ Initial Goals of Your App
From our past conversations and current files, your project aims to:

Let users explore courses after +2 (Science, Commerce, Arts)

View associated colleges, fees, duration

Filter courses by stream

Possibly compare or save favorites

🔧 Suggestions to Improve UX & Performance
1. ✅ Homepage with Smart Navigation
Current issue: May go directly to courses.
Improvement:

Add a clean homepage: intro + 3 main buttons:

🔍 Find Courses

🏫 Browse Colleges

⚖️ Compare Options

2. ✅ Stream Filter as Checkboxes (Done!)
Good start. Expand to allow:

Multi-selection (e.g., Science + Commerce)

Instant JS-based filter without reloading

3. ✅ Add Search Bar for Courses and Colleges
html
Copy
Edit
<input type="text" placeholder="Search courses or colleges..." onkeyup="searchTable()">
Then filter with JavaScript dynamically.

4. ✅ Course Detail Page
Click on a course → Show:

Full description

Colleges that offer it

Apply link or rating if available

5. ✅ College Detail Page
Click on college name → Show:

All courses it offers

Location on Google Map

Avg. fee, seats, reviews (you can start with mock)

6. ✅ User Features (Future)
Later enhancements:

🔐 Login/Register

💾 Save favorite courses

⚖️ Compare 2–3 courses side by side

📊 Add visual graphs for stats (fee trends, seats, etc.)

✅ Performance and SEO Improvements
Backend
Use pagination for large data sets

Cache course/college data on first load

Add API endpoints (e.g., /api/courses)

Frontend
Add meta tags (SEO-friendly title/description)

Responsive UI using Tailwind or Bootstrap

Use charting libraries like Chart.js or ApexCharts
